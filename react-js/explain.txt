Component (App.js)
    # Component is a basic building block of your application
    # React project always build on component.
    # Class Component (Older project)

Component
    state  
        ---> handel a component data
        ---> every component has there own state
        ---> when state data changes component will get re-render
        ---> change  state data (state is mutable in in nature)
    props 
        ---> pass a data form parent component to child component
        ---> props read only (immutable in nature)

Events in component
    function 
            hooks 
                are function in react to handel complex orations
                hook always start with "use"
                useState --> handel state
    
            useState accepts data like
                string , number , boolean , [] , {}

            in return useState gives an array with 2 values
            [value, UpdateFunction]
